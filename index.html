<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Use Cases</h2>


  <section>
    <h2>Annotations Targeting the Full Publication</h2>

    <section>
      <h2>Comment on Publication Title</h2>
      <p>
      A user wishes to write a comment about a particular publication, such as a single issue of a comic or a single book title. The comment is written in plain text or basic HTML, either on the reading platform (such as a web browser or reading system, henceforth "user agent") or in the retailer's platform. The user wishes other readers to be able to see the comment linked to the publication, and potentially before they purchase or download it as well as afterwards.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Tagging a Publication</h2>
      <p>
      A user wishes to organize their personal digital library by tagging the publications that they have access to. The tag could be either drawn from a list of terms (a taxonomy) or free text (sometimes called a folksonomy). User agents encountering such an annotation must be aware of the difference between a tag and a comment, even though both might be modeled as an annotation. Tags are typically rendered separately and very differently from short textual comments. The user then wishes to view their library partitioned via the tags. The user may wish to share their tags with other users to help the recipient categorize their own library, or find publications of mutual interest.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Structured Review of a Publication</h2>
      <p>
      A user wishes to provide a structured review of a particular publication, including pre-defined fields such as a star rating for quality, cost, entertainment or other domain-specific information. The review could also include a full text description, such as the comment in the first use case. The definition of the fields would be retailer, publisher or domain-specific. In the scholarly domain, this could be expected to provide a distributed and standardized peer-review system, rather than the current use of vendor-specific interfaces. In the commercial sector, it could standardize such features as product reviews.
      </p>
    </section>    
    <section>
      <h2>Comment Maintained Separately from Annotation</h2>
      <p>
      A user wishes to link an existing web resource, such as a blog post or uploaded video, to the particular publication that it is about. The comment could be any online resource, in any format. The user wishes other readers to be able to see the resource linked to the publication, and potentially before they purchase or download it as well as afterwards.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h2>Annotation Metadata</h2>
    <p>
    A user wishes to contribute their experience in the form of a comment, and wishes to remain known as the author of that content and annotation that links it to the publication.  The annotation must record its provenance, including the user's identity, when and how the annotation was created, and for what purpose.
    </p>
    </section>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Annotations Targeting Specific Segments</h2>

    <section>
      <h2>Bookmarking Current Reading Position</h2>
      <p>
      A user wishes to have their reading system record the location they have read up to, either with a manual or automatic bookmark. This bookmark should be positioned at a particular point within the publication, such as a page or even an offset within the character stream. The placement of the bookmark might be automatic (the reading system always moves the bookmark as the user reads) or manual (the user moves the bookmark as they desire). When using the reading system again, the user wishes to optionally start reading from the bookmarked position. 
      </p>
      <p> 
      The user also wishes to share this position with others to show how far through the publication they have progressed. This might be publically shared for bragging rights, shared semi-publically such as a reading group or class, or shared privately between platforms that the user has access to in order to maintain the position between devices.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Highlighting a Span of Text</h2>
      <p>
      A user wishes to highlight a span of text in a publication for emphasis. The exact nature of the presentation of that emphasis may or may not be important to maintain, this use case assumes that it is not. The emphasis might be to mark a passage of particular importance, a typo or other mistake, something to cite in another document, to bring to the attention of other readers, or to mark two such selections for comparison. The user may wish to share the highlight, and certainly wishes it to be accessible on multiple platforms to which she has access.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Commenting on a Span of Text</h2>
      <p>
      A user wishes to make a comment about a particular span of text. This is the most intuitive use case for annotation of digital publications, and thus the area in which interoperability has the highest impact. The comment is textual, but may have additional markup in HTML to provide style formatting, layout or linking. The Annotation should be sharable, as per the other use cases.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Annotating Embedded Resources</h2>
      <p>
        A user wishes to make a comment about a particular resource that is embedded as part of the publication, such as an image or video. In the general case, the user would expect to somehow select the embedded resource and then launch the interface for adding comments in the same way as commenting on text. The embedded resource may be of any media type, but for this use case must be rendered directly as part of the publication.
      </p>  
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Annotating Parts of Embedded Resources</h2>
      <p>
      A user wishes to annotate a particular part of an embedded resource, such as a rectangular section of an image or a particular time range of an embedded video file. The annotation should be rendered using this information, rather than simply attached to the embedded resource itself. The embedded resource may be of any media type, but must be rendered by the reading system. Thus video, image, audio and similar are in scope for this use case, but not stylesheets or scripts which are not rendered directly. Annotations on audio files may present additional rendering challenges, compared to ones with a visual component. The user then wishes to share the annotation with others.
      </p>
      <p>
      The parts of resources to be annotated include:
      <ul>
        <li>Character position in a text or data stream</li>
        <li>Time position within an audio or video stream</li>
        <li>x/y points in an area such as an image or video</li>
        <li>x/y/z points in a volume such as a 3d object</li>
        <li>Character ranges within a text or data stream</li>
        <li>Time ranges within an audio or video stream</li>
        <li>Areas within an image, including rectangular, circular and polygonal areas</li>
        <li>Volumes within a 3d object</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Annotating Alt Text of Embedded Resources</h2>
      <p>
      A user wishes to write a comment about a resource embedded within the publication, and to associate it with alternate, accessible representations of that resource, such as the alt text/long desc provided. The comment may be only about part of the alternate representation, and thus segments of the alternate representation must be able to be selected.
      </p>
      <p>
      The alternate representation may or may not have its own URI or other identity; it may exist solely in an attribute of a particular HTML document. For example, a user annotates the depiction of a certain person in a photograph, and wants to align that annotation with the name of the person in the textual description of the photograph.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Annotation Comparing Segments within a Publication</h2>
        <p>
        A user wishes to annotate two or more parts of a publication, an embedded resource, or part of an embedded resource, in order to compare or contrast the targets. This may be to point out inconsistencies in the content or rendering, to make a note about two similar or related passages, or to link part of an embedded resource to where it is referenced in the text.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Annotation Comparing Segments between Publications</h2>
      <p>
      A user wishes to annotate two or more parts of different publications in order to compare or contrast the targets. This may be to make a note about two similar or related passages such as plagiarism, or to link part of an embedded resource to where it is referenced elsewhere. For example, the user may wish to link appearances of the same character in multiple books, popular references to prior works, or examples of passages that contradict each other in scholarly literature.
      </p>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Advanced Annotation Use Cases</h2>

    <section>
      <h2>Cross Format Annotations</h2>
      <p>
        A user wishes to annotate a digital publication in one format and have the annotation appear for different representations of the same resource. For example, an annotation created on an EPUB should also be rendered on the equivalent PDF or HTML page. The annotation can be either on the publication level, or anchored to a particular part of the text. Annotations on embedded resources (such as images) that are embedded without identity in alternate representations are not considered in scope, for example annotating a part of an image in an HTML page which is then embedded within the PDF representation of the page.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Cross Version Annotations</h2>
      <p>
        A user wishes to annotate part of a publication for which she has multiple editions, or that is updated regularly, and have those annotations persist between versions of the same publication. For example, annotating the first line of Hamlet should appear on all of the copies of the play that the user has access to. If the publisher provides a typo-fix, known to happen silently at times, then the annotations should be available on this new version of the publication rather than equally silently disappearing. Thirdly, a teacher annotating a text book should be able to share his annotations with his students even though they do not have the teacher's copy of the text book, but instead have acquired it from different retailers.
      </p>
    </section>    
    <section>
      <h2>Maintaining Annotation Style</h2>
      <p>
      A user wishes to associate a particular style with an annotation, either for the comment or the delineation of the target of the annotation. For example, a user draws a bounding box on an image of the night sky, and wishes to ensure that her client in the future will draw the box in bright green to stand out, and certainly not to draw it in the default black which would be unable to be seen. An academic is highlighting parts of a text in two colors that have meaning to him; red strikethrough is statements that he disagrees with, and green background is for statements that he does agree with. These styles must be maintained for the highlights to be of use in the future. Thirdly, the user should be able to associate style with the comment or body of the annotation, such that the text or resource is rendered in a particular way. Important (to the user) comments might have a bold-face style associated with them, whereas notes may be in italic.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Maintaining Annotation Layout</h2>
      <p>
      A user wishes for their annotations to be presented at a particular location on the page, such that the layout of the annotations doesn't interfere with the reading of the publication. For example, annotations could be styled as a particular height and width, and then put into the margins of the page or over top of other white space. Annotations could be visually ordered such that reading them in the presented order gave a better experience than reading them in the order of the targets within the publication. Thirdly, the layout could be used for organization of thoughts concerning the publication by moving all of the related annotations together spatially. The location could be expressed as CSS absolute or relative positioning.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Recording State of Changing, Online Resources</h2>
      <p>
      A user wishes to annotate the publication as it appears with dynamic resources in a particular state, or in terms of the web architecture, given a particular representation. Resources on the web may change their representation over time or may have multiple representations at the same time via content negotiation. The URI of the resource alone is thus not sufficient to determine the representation that was delivered to the annotator, and additional information such as the time of the request and the HTTP headers sent must be recorded. 
      </p>
    </section> 
    <section>
      <h2>Recording State of User Manipulated Resources</h2>
      <p>
      A user wishes to annotate a publication with embedded, dynamic resources. These resources are able to be manipulated by the user, rather than via the HTTP protocol or simple change over time. For example, a publication may embed a 3 dimensional model of a protein structure that can be rotated, panned and zoomed. Some number of manipulations must be performed in order for the target of the annotation to be visible or understandable, regardless of the accuracy of the target region in the model. The consuming user agent should then be able to reproduce these manipulations in order to allow a third party to see the model as annotated.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Annotation has Multiple, Independent Bodies</h2>
      <p>
        A user wishes to associate multiple resources at the same time with a single target, where the resources are independent of each other. For example, a user exports their browser bookmarks which contain a short note and several tags. Alternatively, tags may be extracted from the comment's text by an automatic process and added to the annotation.
      </p>

    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Annotation has a Choice of Multiple, Dependent Bodies</h2>
      <p>
      A user wishes to annotate a publication or part thereof with multiple options for the body. The options are thus dependent on each other, and only one of the options should be displayed to the user. Examples are: translations of comments, where the user agent could display the French translation of a Spanish comment; alternative formats for the same content, such as HTML with a fallback to plain text; and alternative URLs for the same content, where the content is accessible from each of the URLs.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Determination of Annotation Relevance after Target is Modified</h2>
      <p>
        A user annotates a publication with a correction to the text. The publisher then acts upon this annotation to correct the mistake, or in the scholarly field potentially to retract the publication from the scientific record. After the correction has been made, the annotation no longer applies to the publication and hence should not be displayed. It may be important not to delete the annotation, such that the user gets credit in some system for reporting the correction. The system that maintains the annotation may not be connected to the system that publishes the publication, and hence might not be able to be updated.
      </p>
    </section>    

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Annotation Publication</h2>

    <section>
      <h2>Annotations supplied with Publication</h2>
      <p>
      A publisher has one or more sets of annotations about a publication and wishes to supply those annotations along with the publication. These annotations could be comments by the author (in the same vein as DVD extras commentary), from famous readers, or simply pointers to related works. In an education setting, this functionality could be used to provide additional commentaries on a text book or other publication that are intended to assist the student in understanding the material. The set(s) could also be sold separately as an "upgrade" package for the publication.  The order of the annotations may be important, for example to read the publication in chronological rather than narrative order, or by following the order of a class lectures rather than the order of the chapters in the text book.  The metadata about the collection of annotations is also important, such as who packaged them together and for what purpose.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Third party commentary</h2>
      <p>
      A user or publisher other than the one responsible for the target publication(s) has one or more sets of annotations and wishes to make those available to users. These annotations could be comments by the author, other readers, the publisher, or other sources. 
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Persistence of Annotations</h2>
      <p>
      A user wishes to save the annotation that they have created in order to retrieve it later, regardless of whether it is finished or not. The Annotation should be given a unique and resolvable identifier. The user may wish to save the annotation in their own system, rather than the system which provides the resource being annotated. The user may equally wish to save the annotation in multiple systems. The annotation should persist in local storage if the user is offline, and be persisted globally once the connection is re-established. In the interim, a locally unique identifier should be assigned to the annotation. Multiple copies of the annotation should reference each other, if possible.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>User or System Initiated Transfers between Systems</h2>
      <p>
        Either the user or the system requests that all or some subset of annotations that are maintained be transferred to another system. If the user requests it, then it this enables an export functionality such that the user's annotations can be exported to another platform or device. If the system requests it, then this enables a synchronization functionality where the user's annotations will be maintained in multiple locations for ease of use and preservation, or aggregation for analysis. Both such cases should use the same mechanism.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Annotation (or Part) is not Published Openly</h2>
      <p>
      A user wishes to keep their annotations or personal notes private, or only share with a small group of people such as a reading group, academic research group or only with a set of friends in a social network. Even if the user wishes to keep their annotations private, the ability to transfer the annotations between devices is desirable, so that they be used regardless of the particular reading platform.
      </p>
      <p>
      The user may also wish to keep only some aspect of the annotation private, for example the comment should be protected, while the annotation graph can be shared openly, or vice versa. Regular web based authentication and authorization structures should be used to enable this functionality in an online environment to ensure interoperability.
      </p>

    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Publication (or Part) is not Published Openly</h2>
      <p>
      A user wishes to annotate a resource the she has access to, but requires authentication and/or authorization to view or annotate. The annotation should not circumvent or allow the circumvention of this DRM, for example by reproducing the content of the target publication.
      </p>
    </section>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Other Use Cases</h2>

    <section>
      <h2>Metadata: Specifying Target Audience for Annotation</h2>
      <p>
      A publisher wishes to provide either multiple annotations or multiple bodies/comments with each being intended for a particular, defined audience. This would allow appropriate annotations to be presented based on any information known about the user, such as age, reading ability, accessibility requirements and so forth.      
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Metadata: Categorization of Annotations</h2>
      <p>
      When colors or styles associated with annotations are meaningful to an individual, to a particular group, or generally, a text label should be associated with the annotation group drawn from a list of terms (taxonomy) or free text.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Using Annotation for Contributing Accessibility Information</h2>
      <p>
      An annotation provider (personal or retailer) wishes to provide annotations that give additional information about resources for the purposes of accessibility. For example, images can be easily described in an annotation which is read aloud by the user agent.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Discovery of Annotations</h2>
      <p>
      Users need to easily become aware of and find highlights or annotations, particularly when using a screen reader, a small screen, or seeking sparse annotations in a lengthy work.
      </p>
