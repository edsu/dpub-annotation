<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Use Cases</h2>


  <section>
    <h2>Annotations Targeting the Full Publication</h2>

    <section>
      <h2>Comment on Publication Title</h2>
      <p>
      A user wishes to write a comment about a particular publication, such as a single issue of a comic or a single book title. The comment is written in plain text or basic HTML, either on the reading platform (such as a web browser or reading system, henceforth "user agent") or in the retailer's platform. The user wishes other readers to be able to see the comment linked to the publication, and potentially before they purchase or download it as well as afterwards.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Tagging a Publication</h2>
      <p>
      A user wishes to organize their personal digital library by tagging the publications that they have access to. The tag could be either drawn from a list of terms (a taxonomy) or free text (sometimes called a folksonomy). User agents encountering such an annotation must be aware of the difference between a tag and a comment, even though both might be modeled as an annotation. Tags are typically rendered separately and very differently from short textual comments. The user then wishes to view their library partitioned via the tags. The user may wish to share their tags with other users to help the recipient categorize their own library, or find publications of mutual interest.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Structured Review of a Publication</h2>
      <p>
      A user wishes to provide a structured review of a particular publication, including pre-defined fields such as a star rating for quality, cost, entertainment or other domain-specific information. The review could also include a full text description, such as the comment in the first use case. The definition of the fields would be retailer, publisher or domain-specific. In the scholarly domain, this could be expected to provide a distributed and standardized peer-review system, rather than the current use of vendor-specific interfaces. In the commercial sector, it could standardize such features as product reviews.
      </p>
    </section>    
    <section>
      <h2>Comment Maintained Separately from Annotation</h2>
      <p>
      A user wishes to link an existing web resource, such as a blog post or uploaded video, to the particular publication that it is about. The comment could be any online resource, in any format. The user wishes other readers to be able to see the resource linked to the publication, and potentially before they purchase or download it as well as afterwards.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h2>Annotation Metadata</h2>
    <p>
    A user wishes to contribute their experience in the form of a comment, and wishes to remain known as the author of that content and annotation that links it to the publication.  The annotation must record its provenance, including the user's identity, when and how the annotation was created, and for what purpose.
    </p>
    </section>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Annotations Targeting Specific Segments</h2>

    <section>
      <h2>Bookmarking Current Reading Position</h2>
      <p>
      A user wishes to have their reading system record the location they have read up to, either with a manual or automatic bookmark. This bookmark should be positioned at a particular point within the publication, such as a page or even an offset within the character stream. The placement of the bookmark might be automatic (the reading system always moves the bookmark as the user reads) or manual (the user moves the bookmark as they desire). When using the reading system again, the user wishes to optionally start reading from the bookmarked position. 
      </p>
      <p> 
      The user also wishes to share this position with others to show how far through the publication they have progressed. This might be publically shared for bragging rights, shared semi-publically such as a reading group or class, or shared privately between platforms that the user has access to in order to maintain the position between devices.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Highlighting a Span of Text</h2>
      <p>
      A user wishes to highlight a span of text in a publication for emphasis. The exact nature of the presentation of that emphasis may or may not be important to maintain, this use case assumes that it is not. The emphasis might be to mark a passage of particular importance, a typo or other mistake, something to cite in another document, to bring to the attention of other readers, or to mark two such selections for comparison. The user may wish to share the highlight, and certainly wishes it to be accessible on multiple platforms to which she has access.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Commenting on a Span of Text</h2>
      <p>
      A user wishes to make a comment about a particular span of text. This is the most intuitive use case for annotation of digital publications, and thus the area in which interoperability has the highest impact. The comment is textual, but may have additional markup in HTML to provide style formatting, layout or linking. The Annotation should be sharable, as per the other use cases.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Annotating Embedded Resources</h2>
      <p>
        A user wishes to make a comment about a particular resource that is embedded as part of the publication, such as an image or video. In the general case, the user would expect to somehow select the embedded resource and then launch the interface for adding comments in the same way as commenting on text. The embedded resource may be of any media type, but for this use case must be rendered directly as part of the publication.
      </p>  
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Annotating Parts of Embedded Resources</h2>
      <p>
      A user wishes to annotate a particular part of an embedded resource, such as a rectangular section of an image or a particular time range of an embedded video file. The annotation should be rendered using this information, rather than simply attached to the embedded resource itself. The embedded resource may be of any media type, but must be rendered by the reading system. Thus video, image, audio and similar are in scope for this use case, but not stylesheets or scripts which are not rendered directly. Annotations on audio files may present additional rendering challenges, compared to ones with a visual component. The user then wishes to share the annotation with others.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Annotating Alt Text of Embedded Resources</h2>
      <p>
      A user wishes to write a comment about a resource embedded within the publication, and to associate it with alternate, accessible representations of that resource, such as the alt text/long desc provided. The comment may be only about part of the alternate representation, and thus segments of the alternate representation must be able to be selected.
      </p>
      <p>
      The alternate representation may or may not have its own URI or other identity; it may exist solely in an attribute of a particular HTML document. For example, a user annotates the depiction of a certain person in a photograph, and wants to align that annotation with the name of the person in the textual description of the photograph.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Annotation Comparing Segments within a Publication</h2>
        <p>
        A user wishes to annotate two or more parts of a publication, an embedded resource, or part of an embedded resource, in order to compare or contrast the targets. This may be to point out inconsistencies in the content or rendering, to make a note about two similar or related passages, or to link part of an embedded resource to where it is referenced in the text.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Annotation Comparing Segments between Publications</h2>
      <p>
      A user wishes to annotate two or more parts of different publications in order to compare or contrast the targets. This may be to make a note about two similar or related passages such as plagiarism, or to link part of an embedded resource to where it is referenced elsewhere. For example, the user may wish to link appearances of the same character in multiple books, popular references to prior works, or examples of passages that contradict each other in scholarly literature.

      <h2>User or System Initiated Transfers between Systems</h2>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Annotation (or Part) is not Published Openly</h2>
<p>
A user wishes to keep their annotations or personal notes private, or only share with a small group of people such as a reading group, academic research group or only with a set of friends in a social network. Even if the user wishes to keep their annotations private, the ability to transfer the annotations between devices is desirable, so that they be used regardless of the particular reading platform.
</p>
<p>
The user may also wish to keep only some aspect of the annotation private, for example the comment should be protected, while the annotation graph can be shared openly, or vice versa. Regular web based authentication and authorization structures should be used to enable this functionality in an online environment to ensure interoperability.
